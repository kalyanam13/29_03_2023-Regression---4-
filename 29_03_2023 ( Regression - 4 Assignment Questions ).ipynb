    "In the context of linear regression, the L1 penalty term in Lasso Regression encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector. As the regularization parameter (\n",

    "The feature selection aspect of Lasso Regression is particularly beneficial in situations where the dataset contains a large number of features, and not all of them are necessarily relevant for predicting the target variable.

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can help handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, which can lead to instability and inflated standard errors of the regression coefficients. Lasso Regression, by introducing a penalty term based on the sum of absolute values of the coefficients (\n",
    "�\n",
    "1\n",
    "L1 regularization), encourages sparsity in the model and can be effective in dealing with multicollinearity through feature selection.\n",

    "Here's how Lasso Regression helps address multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression tends to drive some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively excluding the corresponding features from the model.\n",
    "In the presence of multicollinearity, where some features are highly correlated, Lasso may select one of the correlated features and set the coefficients of others to zero.\n",
    "By excluding less relevant features, Lasso helps mitigate the impact of multicollinearity on the model.\n",
    "Automatic Variable Shrinkage:\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Lasso Regression encourages variable shrinkage, reducing the magnitudes of the coefficients.\n",
    "When features are highly correlated, Lasso tends to distribute the importance among them, shrinking the coefficients of correlated features simultaneously.\n",
    "This can help prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single correlated feature.\n",
    "However, it's essential to note that while Lasso Regression can assist in addressing multicollinearity through feature selection, its effectiveness depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the degree of correlation among features. In cases where the multicollinearity is extreme, Ridge Regression (which uses an \n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    "L2 penalty term) might be more suitable, as it also shrinks coefficients but doesn't drive them exactly to zero. Ridge Regression can help control the overall impact of correlated features without excluding any.\n",

    "In practice, the choice between Lasso and Ridge Regression, or a combination of both (Elastic Net), may be guided by cross-validation or other model evaluation techniques to find the regularization parameter (\n",
